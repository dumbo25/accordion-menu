Multi-level accordion menu using only HTML and CSS

I spent a couple of weeks trying out various accordion menu implementations. Editing them, adapting them and giving up on them. The website, CSS Scripts, has a multi-level menu that met all of my requirements and forms the basis of this instructable.

index.html goes in the main directory. Two subdirectories are required: css and img. Download style.css into css directory, and tv.png into img. To run the menu, either 
<ul><li>double click on index.html, or</li>
<li>select index.html, right click, and open with the browser of your choice.</li></ul> 

I used these references:
<ul><li><a href="http://www.cssscript.com/multilevel-accordion-menu-with-plain-html-css/">CSS script Multilevel accordion menu using only HTML and CSS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp">W3Schools accordion menu</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools HTML</a></li></ul>

I created an instructable for the menu
